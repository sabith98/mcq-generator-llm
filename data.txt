Linear Regression
Theory: At its core, linear regression is a method to predict the value of a variable based on the value of one or more other variables. The prediction is made under the assumption that the relationship between these variables is linear, meaning that if you were to plot them on a graph, they would roughly align along a straight line. The goal of linear regression is to find the best-fitting line through the data points that minimizes the differences between the predicted values and the actual values. This best-fitting line is then used to make predictions.

Logistic Regression
Theory: Logistic regression, unlike linear regression, is used when the outcome we are trying to predict is categorical, typically a yes/no outcome. Instead of fitting a straight line to the data, logistic regression fits a curve that estimates the probability of the occurrence of a yes (or 1) outcome. The theory behind logistic regression is to model the odds of the dependent variable as a linear combination of the independent variables, transforming these odds into a probability that lies between 0 and 1. This allows for predicting the likelihood of events, such as whether an email is spam or not, based on given inputs.

Natural Language Processing (NLP)
Theory: NLP is a field at the intersection of computer science, artificial intelligence, and linguistics, aiming to enable machines to understand and interpret human language. The theory behind NLP involves teaching computers the rules and patterns of language, allowing them to process and analyze large amounts of natural language data. NLP encompasses a range of techniques and tools to solve various problems, such as translating text from one language to another, responding to voice commands, or identifying sentiments in text. It bridges human communication and computer understanding by converting language into a form that machines can interpret and respond to.

Large Language Models (LLMs)
Theory: Large language models are advanced algorithms designed to understand, generate, and interact using human-like language based on the training received from extensive datasets of text. These models learn the structure, nuances, and context of language from the data they are trained on, enabling them to generate coherent and contextually relevant text on a wide range of topics. The theory behind these models is grounded in deep learning, where the model learns patterns and relationships within the training data and applies this knowledge to generate new text or interpret input text. LLMs can understand queries, provide answers, compose text, and even create content that feels surprisingly human-like, reflecting their ability to capture the complexity and subtlety of human language.
